# EZSky
 EZSky is a simple weather app written in Swift 3.
 The app uses Core Location to get the geographical coordinates of the user's device.
 Then it uses OpenWeatherMap API, along with Alamofire, to make a web request to receive forecast data for that location.
 Finally the app parses the JSON response from the weather server and updates the UI to dispay a 1-week weather forecast.
